We will have a local clock and a list of clocks

We will create the intial clock from users timezone

Clock Object will look like

- id
- title
- timezone
    - type (UTC, GMT, PST, EST)
    - offset
- date
- events [event1, event2, event3]

Event Object will look like

- id
- clockId
- text
- timezone
- startTime
- endTime

We will use a clock object for local clock.

And use an array of clocks for other clocks. 

We will use event id to create events inside clock
